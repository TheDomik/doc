# Place

**Place** is a describing system. It represents some place in the house, so you can use it to describe where you want to place some stuff, or you can filter cells which looks like what you described and do something with them and so on.

Place is a set of cells, so if you want to describe some place you should select cells which you want to check, active ```enable``` checkbox and add all parts which this place should have into Par

In example above described a room corner. 
> Please note what there are no facade sides of walls, what's because this place uses mostly to place furniture, so we don't care about external look of the house.
> It works because an internal side of the house (include place furniture step also) generates separately from external.
