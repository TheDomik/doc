	_Output:_
	
	- **Forward** - Cells where you should add the door part which shouldn't be rotated
	- **Backward** - Cells where you should add the door part which should be rotated by **180** degress.
	- **Right** - Cells where you should add the door part which should be rotated by **90** degress.
	- **Left** - Cells where you should add the door part which should be rotated by **270** degress.


- ### **Filter Interseсtions Node**

	![[Filter Interseсtions Node.png]]

	The Filter Intersections node returns cells whose positions intersect, so if you have cells set with positions **[0, 0, 0]**, [0, 1, 0], **[1, 1, 0]** and [3, 4, 0], **[0, 0, 0]**, **[1, 1, 0]**, [3, 4, 1], the result will be -> **[0, 0, 0]**, **[1, 1, 0]**.



- ### **Filter Neighbour Cells Node**

	![[Filter Neighbour Cells Node.png]]

	The Filter Neighbour Cells node returns neighbour cells sorted by directions.



- ### **Filter Random Cell Node**

	![[Filter Random Cell Node.png]]

	The Filter Random Cell node returns a random cell from input cells.



- ### **Filter Random Input Node**

	![[Filter Random Input Node.png]]

	The Filter Random Input node returns cells from a random input.



- ### **Filter With Part Node**

	![[Filter With Part Node.png]]

	The Filter With Part node returns cells with a target part.



- ### **Filter Without Part Node**

	![[Filter Without Part Node.png]]

	The Filter Without Part node returns cells without a target part.




## **Flow**


- ### **Exclude Node**

	![[Exclude Node.png]]
	
	The Exclude node returns cells from A input but without cells from B input.



- ### **Merge Node**

	![[Merge Node.png]]

	The Merge node merges cells from input into one cells set (parts sets also will be merged) and then returns them.




- ### **Override Node**

## **Main Nodes**


- ### **End Node**

	![[End Node.png]]

	The End node returns an input cells as a result of Pipeline working.
	The Pipeline should always have one (and only one) End node or it'll not working properly.
	
	You can also use this node for debugging, just connect an input of this node with output of some node to see that's happening in this step of generation.



- ### **Start Node**
