# **Floor Tag**

The **Floor Tag** is a tag that you can add to the **floor** to divide it from others.  
Here's the idea: you have to add a tag to the [[floor]] that you want to change in some specific manner to process it later in the **pipeline** by filtering this floor with a [filter by floor tag node](filter-by-floor-tag.md).
