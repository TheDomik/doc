The pipeline consists of nodes.
Every node is a step of generation of house.

In most cases typical node has two pines: 
- In - Input cells.
- Out - output cells.

Node get cells from Input, process them and returns to Output.
Sometimes it contains parameters. 


Every pipeline instance should have at least two nodes: Start Node and End Node. 
Start Node gets an info from [house generator](house-generator.md) and constructs raw cells.
End Node returns processed nodes to the House Builder.

Here is an example of primitive pipeline.

- **Start** Node  - creates a set of nodes based an info from [the house generator](house-generator.md).
- **Add Parts** Node - adds Floor part and Ceiling part to all cells from input.
- **End** node - returns input cells with floors and ceilings to the House Builder.
