# **Preview System**

The **Preview System** draws configuration files right in the scene.   
It's pretty useful tool to work with them because you can see changes of files visually in real time.  

A done **Preview System** is a prefab in the **Domik** folder. Drag-and-drop it in the scene to start working with it.
