**Furniture** - here you can define a set of furniture or some other placeable objects which can be in rooms with this interior.

**Skins** - a set of skins for rooms with this interior. These skins have higher priority than House Generator skins, so you can use them for define more specific cases like **room walls, floors, furniture look**, etc.

## Placing Rules
 this panel defines special rules for interior placing.

**Max Count Per Floor** - Use it if you want to limit numbers of this interior on the floor. Example: you need maximum two bedrooms per floor because... why someone needs more? O.o

**Prefer Room** - which size of room better for this interior?
- **Small** - prefer small rooms
- **Middle** - prefer regular rooms
- **Big** - prefer big rooms
- **Random** - you don't care

### Parts Limit
Here you defines necessary and forbidden parts of the house.

lets add something:

mode: 
- **Fixed** - only this number of part is acceptable
- **Range** - only this range of part's count is acceptable
- **At least one** - there should be at least one instance of this part
- **Unacceptable** - rooms with this part will be ignored
