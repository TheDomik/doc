# **How to change a house size**


![[Pasted image 20211019122827.png]]  
A size of the house is controlled by the **Base Size** panel in the **House Generator** component.  
This panel defines the target size of the house.  
The final size can be different and depends on the [[pipeline]] logic.

- **Width** - target width of the house.
- **Length** - target length of the house.
- **Floors** - target floors count.

You can select between two size modes: **const** and **rand**

- **const** - constant size.
- **rand** - random size.
