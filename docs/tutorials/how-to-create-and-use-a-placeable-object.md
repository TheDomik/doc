# **How to create and use a Placeable Object**

A **Placeable Object** is an object with rules of placing, so you can use it as furniture or some decorating element. Read more: [placeable object](placeable-object.md).

## **How to create**

To create a **Placeable Object** select some folder -> **right mouse click** -> **Create** -> **Domik** -> **Placeable Object**

To configure a new **Placeable Object**, we have to answer three questions:

- What should it be?
- Where should it be?
- Does it need to transform an environment?

### **What should it be?**

To answer this question we have to select a [[part]] that will represent this **Placeable Object**.   
In this example we'll use a **[0] Venus** part.

### **Where should it be?**


In this example we'll try to place a Venus sculpture in-front of giant mirror somethere in the house.

Add some places to the Possible Places list to define there you want to place this object.  
We'll place Venus in close to the wall and in corners in this example.
