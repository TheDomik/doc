The **place** is a description of some place in the house. Read more [[place]].  

To create a place right click on some folder -> **Create** -> **Domik** -> **Place**

We'll create a room corner with window in this tutorial.  
We have to select central **cell** and set [[part]]s to recreate a look of the place.

Done!   
Now we can use it in the [Placeable Object](placeable-object.md) to define where we want to place it.

Final step - add it to an [[interior]] of the room there we want to see it.

Yep, now it has been placed in the corner with window.
